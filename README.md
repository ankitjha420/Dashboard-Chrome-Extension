# Dashboard-Chrome-Extension

A chrome extension that replaces the New Tab screen with a random "nature" themed image background using the Unsplash API. The dashboard also features latest crypto currency prices as well as weather conditions in the user's city (this is done using Coingecko API for crypto prices and Open weather map API for weather data). The background images are randomly picked out of thousands of similar images and therefore the user gets a new image every time the program runs.
